    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <h2>The mission is to recreate revenge of the sith in Minecraft.</h2>
    <p>
      Or a little bit more detailed: our mission is to bring the excellent work that George Lucas has done into minecraft.
      Our first target is to recreate <span class="bold">Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith</span> and translate it into minecraft. We don't plan to do this as an animation(blender,cinema4d,etc) but rather ingame. Everything will be recorded in minecraft and then edited - so the space ships are flying, the blaster actually shoots and so on.
      But before we do that we are creating a trailer as an proof of concept and effect test ... and a star wars trailer in minecraft itself is already pretty cool. If you want to keep up-to-date or even help you can use the links below.
